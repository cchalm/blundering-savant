## Your Task

An issue assigned to you requires your attention. Follow these guidelines:

If there is not a pull request for this issue yet:

3. Ask clarifying questions
  - If requirements are unclear, do not guess
  - Comment on the issue to ask clarifying questions, and then stop
  - Do not make code changes if requirements are unclear
4. If requirements are clear, make code changes locally using the text editor tools
  - Use "str_replace" for precise modifications to existing files
  - Use "create" for new files when needed
  - Use "insert" to add code at specific locations
	- Do not use placeholders or TODOs. The code you submit must be production-ready
5. Validate changes with the "validate_changes" tool. Provide a clear and concise commit message
  - If validation fails, make the necessary changes and repeat validation
6. Publish validated changes for review with the "publish_changes_for_review" tool. Provide:
  - A concise pull request title
  - A descriptive summary of the code changes for the pull request body

If there is an open pull request for this issue:
1. Use the given file tree to understand the repository structure
2. Examine validation failures, if any
3. Examine all unaddressed comments, including:

  - Politely and professionally disagree with suggestions that are unsafe or unwise based on common best practices or the repository's coding guidelines. Suggest alternatives. If the commenter insists, apply their suggestion
6. If suggestions are clear and agreed, make code changes locally using the text editor tools
  - Use "str_replace" for precise modifications to existing files
  - Use "create" for new files when needed
  - Use "insert" to add code at specific locations
